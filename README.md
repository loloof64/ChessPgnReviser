# Chess Pgn Reviser

Load your pgn and play try to remember the moves against the engine.
You select the types (human/computer) for both sides: then for each move
* if it is your turn, you have to guess either the main line or one of the variant
* if it is the computer turn, you will have to select the move if any variant, otherwise, computer will play the move automatically.

You should take care that each game of the pgn has at least a star as a result, and is not empty. Otherwise some game may be forgotten.
